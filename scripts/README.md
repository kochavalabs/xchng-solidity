## Running Scripts to test Dutch Auction

In order to help run, manage, and interact with the Token and Auction contract there are a couple helper scripts in the `scripts/` directory. Once the contracts have been deployed, you can run these scripts to interact with them. ENV vars can be used to configure these scripts. NOTE: Contract addresses are deterministic, which means if you deploy the contracts for the first time to a fresh ganache instance the addresses for those contracts will be the same each time.

It is also possible to use these scripts to test contracts on Ropsten testnet by setting the `MNEMONIC` for the hdwallet and `NODE_ADDRESS` to a Ropsten testnet node.

It is **NOT** recommended to try using these scripts on the main Ethereum network as the commands will require the use of Ether for gas and have not been optimized for gas usage.

First make sure the truffle migrations have been deployed to the ganache network:

```
truffle migrate --network ganache --reset
```

Output from the deploy will show the `TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to use. Example:

```
Using network 'ganache'.

`TOKEN_ADDRESS = 0x820ed62b1dfcd1e18a9c9c83de058b28059c0ab0`

`CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 0x89c83c691cb22c42aee0b13c3709f0d305b2a163`

### Setup

The setup script will initialize the Xchng Token, authorize the Auction to transfer tokens, setup the auction, and start it. To run the setup script simply run the following command.

```
node scripts/setup.js
```

#### Configuration

| ENV | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| NODE_ADDR | http://localhost:7545 | By default set to local ganache |
| MNEMONIC | none | Mnemonic used to generate HDWallet accounts |
| AUCTION_ADDRESS | none | The address of the auction |
| TOKEN_ADDRESS | none | The address of the token |
| NUM_TOKENS_AVAILABLE | '600000000000000000000000000' | The number of Xchng tokens to preallocate |

### Bid

The bid script will submit a bid to the auction. By default it bids 1 ETH, and chooses a random ganache account to bid from. Both of those behaviors can be overridden.

```
node scripts/bid.js
```

#### Configuration

| ENV | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| NODE_ADDR | http://localhost:7545 | By default set to local ganache |
| MNEMONIC | none | Mnemonic used to generate HDWallet accounts |
| AUCTION_ADDRESS | none | The address of the auction |
| TOKEN_ADDRESS | none | The address of the token |
| FROM_ADDRESS | None | The address to bid from, by default this is 'None' which causes the script to randomly choose one of the ganache addresses to bid from |
| BID_AMOUNT | '1' | The amount of ETH to bid, this needs to be _at least_ 1 ETH |

### Pause

The pause script will pause either the token or auction contract.  The owner of the contracts must be the account[0] generated by the HDWallet mnemonic.

```
node scripts/pause.js [pause | unpause] [token | auction]
```

#### Configuration

| ENV | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| NODE_ADDR | http://localhost:7545 | By default set to local ganache |
| MNEMONIC | none | Mnemonic used to generate HDWallet accounts |
| AUCTION_ADDRESS | none | The address of the auction |
| TOKEN_ADDRESS | none | The address of the token |

### Whitelist

The whitelist script will whitelist an address for the Dutch Auction contract.  The owner of the auction contract must be the account[0] generated by the HDWallet mnemonic.

```
node scripts/whitelist.js [Address]
```

#### Configuration

| ENV | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| NODE_ADDR | http://localhost:7545 | By default set to local ganache |
| MNEMONIC | none | Mnemonic used to generate HDWallet accounts |
| AUCTION_ADDRESS | none | The address of the auction |

### Price Check

The pricecheck script will check the current price and missing funds for the Dutch Auction contract.  These are both `view` level functions on the contract and should return immediatly without submitting a transaction.

```
node pricecheck.js
```

#### Configuration

| ENV | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| NODE_ADDR | http://localhost:7545 | By default set to local ganache |
| MNEMONIC | none | Mnemonic used to generate HDWallet accounts |
| AUCTION_ADDRESS | none | The address of the auction |
